How to program autonomous routines:


----- How to drive -----
L = -Left/Type- column
R = -Rht/Spd- column
S = -Sft/Tgt- column

To drive, input:
	L | speed
		encoder distance
	R | speed
		encoder distance
	
To strafe, input:
	S | speed
		enc(distance)
		L_US(distance)
		R_US(distance)

To follow a line, input:
	L | CNTR_LINE
	R | speed
	S | 0
	
To turn with the gyro, input:
	L | GYRO_TURN
	R | speed
	S | target rotation
	
To turn left wheels with the gyro, input:
	L | GYRO_LEFT
	R | speed
	S | target rotation
	
To turn right wheels with the gyro, input:
	L | GYRO_RIHT
	R | speed
	S | target rotation
	
To follow the left wall, input:
	L | LEFT_WALL
	R | speed
	S | target distance from wall
	
To follow the right wall, input:
	L | RIHT_WALL
	R | speed
	S | target distance from wall


----- How to do other things -----
LIFT | Input speed or height into the -Lift- column
SKIP TO STEP | Input wanted step into the -Action- column of RESET_AUTO
